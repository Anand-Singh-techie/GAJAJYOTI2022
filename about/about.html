   <center><h1> ABOUT CUTM</h1></center>
   <p><center><h2><b>The journey of Centurion University of Technology and Management <br>(CUTM) began in the year 2005 by a group of ambitious academics <br>with aspirations to provide
   high quality education both nationally and <br> internationally. 
  The first step in this direction was to take over an <br>ailing  engineering Institute, the Jagannath Institute for Technology <br> and Management (JITM) in one of the most
   challenging tribal districts <br>of Odisha and one which was considered 
   to be a left-wing extremist affected area. <br>Subsequently, JITM was transformed into Centurion University of Technology <br>and Management in August 2010, 
   through an act of Odisha Legislative Assembly.</b></h2></p></center>
